# ArtExhibit
Art Exhibit website that responsively showcases art photos

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I created a responsive Art Exhibit website that showcases some of the artwork by Wayne Thiebaud.
Website precisely utilized proper color schemes to ensure coordination and appeal to the eyes. Modern techniques for building
user interfaces were implemented to optimize user-interactivity. 

IDE includes Sublime Text Editor and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
